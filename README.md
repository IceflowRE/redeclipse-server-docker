This provides the source for an easy handling and maintaining Docker image of a [Red Eclipse](https://redeclipse.net/)
Server.  
Additional with a Go console application which will update the DockerHub images.  
Currently the Docker images are build against the latest commits and will be checked for updates once a day.

- [`stable`](https://github.com/IceflowRE/redeclipse-server-docker/blob/main/Dockerfile_stable)
- [`v1.5.3`](https://github.com/IceflowRE/redeclipse-server-docker/blob/main/Dockerfile_stable)

\* *`stable` does not mark the latest stable release, it tags the latest legacy version (v1.x.x)*

Available architectures are `amd64`.

If your architecture is not available check if RE can be build on that architecture and follow [An image is not available for my architecture](#an-image-is-not-available-for-my-architecture).

## How to use this image

We will use docker compose as it is the easiest way to manage the running container.

Create a Docker Compose file and name it `docker-compose.yml`, as a starting point you can use [docker-compose-template.yml](https://github.com/IceflowRE/redeclipse-server-docker/blob/main/docker-compose-template.yml)

Replace the `<variable>` including the brackets.

```yml
services:
    # <service_name>: the name to access this later (e.g. `master`, `v2_0_0`)
    <service_name>:
        # <tag>: the image tag you want to use (e.g. `master`, `v2.0.0`)
        image: iceflower/redeclipse-server:<tag>
        ports:
            # <serverport>: this port will be published and accessible from outside,
            # the port number must match port defined in RE's `servinit.cfg`
            - "<serverport>:<serverport>/udp"
            # <serverport + 1>: the server port above plus one
            - "<serverport + 1>:<serverport + 1>/udp"
        restart: unless-stopped
        volumes:
            # <RE home dir>: path to the RE home/ config directory on your host system 
            # (e.g. `/home/iceflower/re-master/home`)
            - type: bind
              source: <RE home dir>
              target: /re-server-config/home
              read_only: true
            # <RE package dir>: path to the RE package directory on your host system, you can place custom maps there
            # if you do not want this, just remove this section (e.g. `/home/iceflower/re-master/package`)
            - type: bind
              source: /home/iceflower/redeclipse-config/package
              target: /re-server-config/package
              read_only: true
            # <sauerbraten dir>: path to a Sauerbraten directory/installation
            # if you use a version higher or equal `v2.0.0` or `master` remove this section
            # (e.g. `/home/iceflower/sauerbraten`)
            - type: bind
              source: <sauerbraten dir>
              target: /re-server-config/sauer
              read_only: true
        logging:
            options:
                max-size: "2000k"
                max-file: "10"
```

To pull/start/stop a specific service add the service name to the end otherwise, it is applied to all.

- Pull the latest docker image from Docker Hub for all defined services  
  `docker compose pull`

- Start/ Restart container  
  `docker compose up -d`

- Shutdown and wait a maximum of 10 minutes before forcing it  
  `docker compose stop --time=600`

#### Multiple Server

Copy and paste the whole service section above and change the values (service name, port, home directory, etc.)

### An image is not available for my architecture

First check if Red Eclipse can be build on your architecture. If yes, continue.

Follow the table below to copy the required `Dockerfile` next to your `docker-compose.yml`. Have the chosen `Dockerfile` in mind.

| Version  |     Dockerfile      |
|:--------:|:-------------------:|
|  master  | `Dockerfile_master` |
|  stable  | `Dockerfile_stable` |
| < v2.0.0 | `Dockerfile_stable` |
|  v2.0.0  | `Dockerfile_2_0_0`  |

Create a file named `.dockerignore` next to the `Dockerfile` with the content `**`.

Edit your `docker-compose-yml` and replace the `image: ...` part in the service you want to build with

```yml
build:
    # <dockerfile>: name of the dockerfile, usable for the chosen tag below
    dockerfile: <dockerfile>
    args:
        # <tag>: can be any git reference (branch name, tag, SHA) (e.g. `master`, `v2.0.0`, ...)
        TAG: <tag>
        RE_COMMIT: ""
        ALPINE_SHA: ""
        DOCKERFILE_SHA: ""
```

Then use `docker compose build` to build the custom image.

## Update server automatically

Create a file with the name `update-server.sh` (make sure it has executable rights).
You can place it right next to the `docker-compose.yml`.

Adjust the directory path according where you place the file.

```bash
#!/bin/bash -e

# EDIT NEXT LINE
cd /home/iceflower/re/
docker compose stop -t 600
# docker compose build
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

To update regularly you can create a cron job, how to do this exactly refer to a guide matching your OS.

```cron
0 3 * * * /home/iceflower/re/update-server.sh > /home/iceflower/re/cron.log 2>&1
```

This will update every day at 3:00.

## DockerHub Image Updater

Build with

```shell
cd go-docker-updater
go build -x -o updater ./cmd/updater/
```

For more options see `--help`.

The updater is used to update the DockerHub images.
