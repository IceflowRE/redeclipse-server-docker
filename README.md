  - *Create a copy with name `docker-compose.yml`*
  - *Change all the `<variable>` inside the file, to their respective values*

- Pull latest docker image from Docker Hub for all defined services  
`docker-compose pull`

- Start/ Restart container (for all specified services, dont write any name)  
`docker-compose -p re-server up -d <name>`

- Shutdown and wait a maximum of 10 seconds before forcing (for all specified services, dont write any name)  
`docker-compose stop <name>`

#### Multiple Server
Copy and paste the whole section below the point `services` and change the values. Then start it with the new other name.

#### Example
- Create own Docker Compose file, as base you can use [docker-compose.yml.template](./docker-compose.yml.template)  
[docker-compose.yml.example](./docker-compose.yml.example)

- Pull latest docker image from Docker Hub for all defined services  
`docker-compose pull`

- Start/ Restart container
